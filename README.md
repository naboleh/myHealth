# Development process / About the process
*(not sure what to name this section)*

Our team used [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) *(should include Android Studio too?)* to develop the front-end of the Android application. We used [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) to assist in the back-end database programming for users' information. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/login) was used for the initial ideation and prototyping.
